        <h3>Contrary to what social media will have you believe, it [<span class="name">Epstein</span> List] is actually dozens of 
            documents from a 2015 court case filed by <span class="name">Epstein</span> accuser <span class="name">Virginia Giuffre</span>
             against his co-conspirator <span class="name">Ghislaine Maxwell</span>, who has been convicted of child sex trafficking. 
             These documents reference roughly 150 of Epstein’s associates, including <span class="name">Clinton</span> 
             and <span class="name">Trump</span>, but don’t provide significant new information so much as they offer a more in-depth look at 
             the people in <span class="name">Epstein’s</span> circles.</h3>
